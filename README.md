## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
npm test
```

Run tests in watch mode:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

## Localization

The application uses `next-intl` for internationalization. All user-facing text is stored in the `messages` directory.

- `messages/en.json`: English translations
- `messages/no.json`: Norwegian translations

When adding or updating text, be sure to update both files to maintain consistency.

## Theme Support

The application supports both light and dark themes using `next-themes`. Theme-related components and configuration can be found in `components/theme`. All motion components and UI elements are designed to work seamlessly with both themes.

## Animation System

The application uses the Motion library (successor to Framer Motion) for smooth animations:

- **Motion Components**: Pre-built animation components in `components/motion/`
- **Barrel Exports**: Consistent imports from `components/motion/index.ts`
- **Performance Optimized**: Uses proper animation properties for smooth performance
- **Theme Compatible**: All animations work with both light and dark themes

Available motion components:
- `FadeIn`, `SlideIn`, `ScaleIn` - Basic entrance animations
- `PageTransition` - Page-level transitions
- `CardMotion` - Card hover and entrance effects
- `StaggerContainer` - Staggered child animations
- `ShakeMotion` - Error feedback animations with imperative API

## Development

### Running Tests
```bash
npm test              # Run all tests
npm run test:watch    # Run tests in watch mode
```

### Environment Setup
- Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`
- Add required environment variables
- Feature flags require development server restart

### VS Code Integration
Use the provided VS Code task "Start Development Server" for optimal development experience.

## Deployment

The easiest way to deploy this Next.js application is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new).
