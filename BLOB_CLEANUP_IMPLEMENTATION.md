# Blob Cleanup Implementation

## Problem
When users removed files using the 'X' button, the PDFs remained in Vercel Blob storage, causing unnecessary storage costs and clutter.

## Solution
Implemented comprehensive blob cleanup that removes files from Vercel Blob storage when users remove them from the UI.

## Changes Made

### 1. New API Endpoint: `/api/delete-blob/route.ts`
- **Purpose**: Safely delete blobs from Vercel Blob storage
- **Method**: POST with blob URL in request body
- **Security**: Validates blob URL format
- **Error handling**: Graceful failure without breaking UI

### 2. Updated `useFileUpload.ts` Hook
- **New function**: `deleteBlobFromUrl()` - calls delete API
- **Updated**: `removeFile()` - now async, deletes blob before UI cleanup
- **Updated**: `openFileDialog()` - cleans up existing blob before opening dialog
- **Error handling**: Blob deletion failures don't break user experience

### 3. Updated `FileUploadSection.tsx`
- **Remove button**: Now handles async blob deletion
- **File picker**: Cleans up existing blobs before new selection
- **Keyboard navigation**: Updated to handle async operations

### 4. Vercel Configuration
- **Added**: `delete-blob` endpoint with 10s timeout in `vercel.json`

## Cleanup Flow

### When User Clicks Remove (X):
1. 🗑️ Delete blob from Vercel storage
2. 🧹 Clear file from UI state  
3. 📝 Show "File removed" message
4. 🔄 Reset file input

### When User Selects New File:
1. 🗑️ Delete any existing blob
2. 🧹 Clear old file from UI
3. 📁 Open file picker
4. ⬆️ Upload new file to blob

### After Analysis Completes:
- ✅ API automatically deletes blob (existing functionality)
- 🏠 User navigates to results page

## Benefits
- ✅ **No storage waste**: Blobs are cleaned up immediately
- ✅ **Cost efficient**: No accumulation of unused files  
- ✅ **User-friendly**: Seamless experience, errors don't break UI
- ✅ **Comprehensive**: Cleanup on remove, replace, and after analysis

## Files Modified
- `hooks/useFileUpload.ts` - Added blob deletion logic
- `components/upload/FileUploadSection.tsx` - Updated to handle async operations
- `app/api/delete-blob/route.ts` - New endpoint for blob deletion
- `vercel.json` - Added function timeout configuration

## Result
Users can now remove files with confidence that storage is properly cleaned up, preventing accumulation of unused blobs in Vercel storage.
