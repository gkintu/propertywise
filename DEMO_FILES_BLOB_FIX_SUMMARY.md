# Demo Files Blob Storage Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved ✅
Fixed the "Request Entity Too Large" and "blob already exists" errors when clicking demo files on the home page.

## Root Cause
Demo files were being uploaded to Vercel Blob storage every time a user clicked them, causing:
- **"blob already exists"** errors on subsequent clicks
- **Large file size issues** hitting Vercel function limits

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Pre-uploaded Demo Files to Blob Storage
- Created script: `scripts/upload-demo-files.js`
- Uploaded all 3 demo PDFs once to get permanent blob URLs:
  - **Alv Johnsens vei 1 - Drammen**: `https://zi0e7q9wpclfxshj.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/demo-alv-johnsens-vei-1.pdf`
  - **Bolette brygge 5 - Oslo**: `https://zi0e7q9wpclfxshj.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/demo-bolette-brygge-5.pdf`  
  - **Sanengveien 1 - Fredrikstad**: `https://zi0e7q9wpclfxshj.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/demo-sanengveien-1.pdf`

### 2. Updated Demo Files Component
- Modified `components/upload/DemoFilesSection.tsx`
- **Before**: Uploaded file to blob storage on every click
- **After**: Uses pre-existing permanent blob URLs
- Removed `upload()` function call that was causing conflicts

### 3. Preserved File Loading Flow
- Still fetches file from `/api/demo-pdf` for File object creation
- Attaches permanent `blobUrl` to the File object
- Maintains compatibility with existing analysis workflow

## Files Modified
- ✅ `components/upload/DemoFilesSection.tsx` - Updated to use permanent blob URLs
- ✅ `scripts/upload-demo-files.js` - New script for one-time blob upload
- ✅ `package.json` - Added `upload-demo-files` script

## Benefits
- ✅ **No more "blob already exists" errors**
- ✅ **No more file size limit issues** 
- ✅ **Faster demo file loading** (no upload step)
- ✅ **Consistent blob URLs** for demo files
- ✅ **Cost efficient** (no redundant uploads)

## Security
- ✅ Used `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` environment variable safely
- ✅ No tokens exposed in code or logs
- ✅ Permanent blob URLs are public (appropriate for demo files)

## Usage
Demo files now work seamlessly:
1. User clicks demo file card
2. File fetched from local `/api/demo-pdf` endpoint  
3. Pre-existing blob URL attached
4. Ready for analysis immediately

## Result
The demo files are now permanently available in Vercel Blob storage and will never cause upload conflicts or size limit errors again!
