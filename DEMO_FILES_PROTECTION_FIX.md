# Demo Files Blob Protection Fix

## Problem Identified ⚠️
When users clicked the "X" button to remove demo files, the app was incorrectly deleting the permanent demo file blobs from Vercel Blob storage. This would make the demo files unavailable for future users.

## Root Cause
The `removeFile()` and `openFileDialog()` functions in `useFileUpload.ts` were deleting ALL blob URLs without distinguishing between:
- **Demo files**: Permanent blobs that should never be deleted
- **User uploads**: Temporary blobs that should be cleaned up

## Solution Implemented ✅

### 1. Created Demo File Detection
```typescript
// Demo file blob URLs that should never be deleted
const DEMO_FILE_BLOB_IDENTIFIERS = [
  'demo-alv-johnsens-vei-1',
  'demo-bolette-brygge-5', 
  'demo-sanengveien-1'
];

const isDemoFileBlob = (blobUrl: string): boolean => {
  return DEMO_FILE_BLOB_IDENTIFIERS.some(identifier => blobUrl.includes(identifier));
};
```

### 2. Protected Demo Files in removeFile()
**Before:**
```typescript
if (fileWithBlobUrl.blobUrl) {
  await deleteBlobFromUrl(fileWithBlobUrl.blobUrl); // ❌ Always deleted
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
if (fileWithBlobUrl.blobUrl && !isDemoFileBlob(fileWithBlobUrl.blobUrl)) {
  await deleteBlobFromUrl(fileWithBlobUrl.blobUrl); // ✅ Only delete non-demo files
}
```

### 3. Protected Demo Files in openFileDialog()
Applied the same protection when clearing files before opening the file dialog.

## Behavior Now ✅

### Demo Files (Protected):
- ✅ User clicks demo file → loads normally
- ✅ User clicks "X" button → removes from UI but **blob stays in storage**
- ✅ Demo file remains available for all future users
- ✅ No accidental deletion of permanent demo blobs

### User Uploaded Files (Cleaned):
- ✅ User uploads file → creates temporary blob
- ✅ User clicks "X" button → removes from UI **AND deletes blob**
- ✅ User opens file dialog → cleans up previous blob
- ✅ Proper cleanup prevents blob storage accumulation

## Files Modified
- ✅ `hooks/useFileUpload.ts` - Added demo file protection logic

## Security & Maintenance
- ✅ Demo file identifiers are clearly defined at the top
- ✅ Easy to add new demo files by updating the identifiers array
- ✅ Robust string matching prevents accidental deletions
- ✅ No impact on existing user upload workflow

## Result
Demo files are now permanently protected from accidental deletion while maintaining proper cleanup for user-uploaded files!
