# Gemini API quickstart

This quickstart shows you how to install our libraries and make your first Gemini API request.

## Before you begin

You need a Gemini API key. If you don't already have one, you can get it for free in Google AI Studio.

## Install the Google GenAI SDK

### JavaScript

Using Node.js v18+, install the Google Gen AI SDK for TypeScript and JavaScript using the following npm command:

```bash
npm install @google/genai
```

## Make your first request

Here is an example that uses generateContent method to send a request to the Gemini API using Gemini 2.5 flash model.

### JavaScript

```javascript
import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";
const ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: " YOUR_API_KEY " });

async function main() {
  const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
    model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents: "Explain how AI works in a few words",
  });
  console.log(response.text);
}

main();
```

## "Thinking" is on by default on many of our code samples

Many code samples on this site use the Gemini 2.5 Flash model, which has the "thinking" feature enabled by default to enhance response quality. You should be aware that this may increase response time and token usage. If you prioritize speed or wish to minimize costs, you can disable this feature by setting the thinking budget to zero, as shown in the examples below. For more details, see the thinking guide.

**Note:** Thinking is only available on Gemini 2.5 series models and can't be disabled on Gemini 2.5 Pro.

### JavaScript

```javascript
import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";
const ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: "GEMINI_API_KEY" });

async function main() {
  const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
    model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents: "Explain how AI works in a few words",
    config: {
      thinkingConfig: {
        thinkingBudget: 0, // Disables thinking
      },
    }
  });
  console.log(response.text);
}

await main();
```
